## How it works

This is a package that gives two different mulitplexers a spin.  The core is a set of 4 passgates (letting signals pass between A and Z sides) which are "one-hot", so one of them is enabled at a time.  If you tie all the Zs together, you have a simple 4:1 mux.  The 8 passgate version is an extension of this, and it may be used as 8 analog switches (only one on at a time) or an 8:1 mux.

In order to give it a good run, numerous test scenarios were implemented that allow charactirizing the passgates themselves, as well as chaining the muxes together.

This system has, in addition to the muxes, a ring oscillator and driver (created by Matt Venn), a manually laid out digital block to convert bits to the one-hot signals needed to control the passgates, and an openlane generate simple counter, that is clocked directly from the ring oscillator, such that we can drive it at hundreds of megahertz, divide down the clocking and shoot it through the mux over an analog pin.

## Using in your projects

I've gotten rid of some of the noise from this testbench playground, packaged up the useful bits and made nicer symbols in the [analog mux kit repo](https://github.com/psychogenic/analogmuxkit) so you can hopefully drop these into your own projects without too much hassle.

This allows for access to multiple analog signals while minimizing the number of pins required, and may also be of use within projects themselves.

The basic building block is a series of passgates, in essence analog switches, which are controlled by a small digital block, laid out by hand to keep it tight and minimize footprint.

The digital block ensures only one of the switches is active at any given time, so one side may safely be tied together to for n:1 multiplexers as in the image above.


### Space Requirements 

Passgate performance is mainly a tradeoff against the size required.  I tried to make these large enough to be well behaved while not taking up all the space, so each unit eats up about 24x5 microns.  The analog front-end of the 4:1 mux therefore takes about 20x25 um, whereas the digital control block needs about 10x10 microns.  Both the 4x and 8x configurations use the same digital block as control.

In this [TT09 mux test submission](https://github.com/psychogenic/tt09-analogmux), I have 3 multiplexers (two 4:1 and one 8:1) connected to various things in a 2x1 tile:

The digital blob on the bottom right is just a 10-bit counter, generated via openlane, which gives you an idea of relative sizes.


### Passgates

Passgates are simple switches using two FETs.

These have some internal resistance, which isn't actually linear--it depends on the voltage coming in.  RDS was characterized for a single passgate and it's not fantastic as it can be almost 400 ohm, but as long as the destination has high enough impedance this shouldn't be an issue.

## Available Cells

There are three units that may be useful in the project, an 8:1 MUX, a 4-switch one-hot arrangement, and a convenience cell where the 4-switches are tied together on one side to provide a 4:1 MUX.

### 8:1 MUX

The 8:1 multiplexer has a symbol and accompanying cell as well as parasitic extraction that was used in simulation:

This is basically two sets of 4x passgates, controlled by the digital block, and passing through a second switch to perform the final selection.


### 4-switch, one hot

The 4-switch arrangement allows you to have 4 switches, only one of which is active and letting signal through at a time.  It can be made into a 4:1 mux by tying all the i/o from one side together, as shown here:

![4x one hot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psychogenic/tt09-analogmux/main/docs/images/4onehottb.png)

It's symbol is a bit ugly, but it works.

### 4:1 MUX

If you want the multiplexer function, a symbol and extra hierarchy cell does that typing together for you.
